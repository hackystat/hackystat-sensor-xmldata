Implements a Xml sensor for the Ant build system, which sends sensor 
data generated by any tool to a Hackystat server.

This sensor is designed to run after a task in Ant, which creates a XML file that
is compatible with the XML sensor data stored in Hackystat. This sensor reads in this file 
and uses that data to construct the notification that is sent to the server.
